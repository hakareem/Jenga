This is a turn-based tower construction/destruction game with a mass-spring simulation. You can build complex structures (e.g. 'The Eiffel Tower') 
through a simple UI, that models stress and strain under gravity. You get to take turns to remove a part until the structure fails and collapses spectacularly. Can be played
as a two player - take it in turns to remove a piece until the collapse.
